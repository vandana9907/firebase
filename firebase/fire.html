                    Gameloft, an award-winning global game studio, needed a robust crash reporting tool to monitor game
                    stability across their vast portfolio in a holistic way. They turned to Crashlytics to reduce crash
                    rates, improve player engagement, and improve their Play Store rating.

                        Pomelo Games, one of the top game studios in Uruguay, used Remote Config, A/B Testing, Google
                        Analytics, and Crashlytics to test interstitial ads in their game. This led to an increase in
                        both ad revenue and in-app purchases with no decline in retention or stability.
